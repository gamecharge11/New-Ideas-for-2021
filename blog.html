        <!-- Technology section -->
        <h1 class="t-1-h">Technology</h1>
        <p>Technology today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually it will become exponential. However, it is not only technology trends and top technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year due to the outbreak of COVID-19 making IT professionals realize that their role will not stay the same in the contactless world tomorrow. An IT professional in 2020-21 will constantly be learning, unlearning and relearning (out of necessity if not desire).
            It means staying current with new technology trends by keeping your eyes on the future to know which skills you’ll need to know to secure a safe job tomorrow and even learn how to get there. All bows to the worldwide pandemic, most of the global IT population is sitting back, working from home. If you wish to make the most of your time at home, here are top 3 new technology trends you should watch for – 
            </p>
            <h1 class="ai">1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h1>
            <h4 class="ai-d">Artificial Intelligence or AI, is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.
                The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching over $57 billion in 2021.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development, programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect) - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!
                </h4>
            <h1 id="ec">2. Edge computing</h1>
            <h4 class="ec-d">
                Formerly a new technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But it’s no longer the emerging technology trend. Edge is.
                
                As the quantity of data organizations are dealing with continues to increase, they have realized the shortcomings of cloud computing in some situations. Edge computing is designed to help solve some of those problems as a way to bypass the latency caused by cloud computing and getting data to a data centre for processing. It can exist “on the edge,” if you will, closer to where computing needs to happen. For this reason, edge computing can be used to process time-sensitive data in remote locations with limited or no connectivity to a centralized location. In those situations, edge computing can act like mini data centres. 
                
                Edge computing will increase as use of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices increases. By 2022, the global edge computing market is expected to reach $6.72 billion. And this new technology trend is only meant to grow and nothing less, creating various jobs, primarily for software engineers.
                </h4>
                <h1 class="qc">3. Quantum Computing</h1>
                <h4 class="qc-d">Next remarkable technology trend is quantum computing, which is a form of computing that takes advantage of quantum phenomena like superposition and quantum entanglement. This amazing technology trend is also involved in preventing the spread of the coronavirus, and to develop potential vaccines, thanks to its ability to easily query, monitor, analyse and act on data, regardless of the source. Another field where quantum computing is finding applications is banking and finance, to manage credit risk, for high frequency trading and fraud detection.

                    Quantum computers are now a multitude times faster than regular computers and huge brands like Splunk, Honeywell, Microsoft, AWS, Google and many others are now involved in making innovations in the field of Quantum Computing. The revenues for the global quantum computing market are projected to surpass $2.5 billion by 2029. And to make a mark in this new trending technology, you need to have experience with quantum mechanics, linear algebra, probability, information theory, and machine learning.
                    </h4>
            <h1 class="t-2-h">Medicine</h1>
            <h4 class="t-2-p">An up-and-coming gene therapy for blood disorders. A new class of medications for cystic fibrosis. Increased access to telemedicine. These are some of the innovations that will enhance healing and change healthcare in the coming year, according to a distinguished panel of clinicians and researchers from Cleveland Clinic.

                In conjunction with the 2020 Medical Innovation Summit, Cleveland Clinic announced the Top 10 Medical Innovations for 2021. Now in its 18th year, the annual Medical Innovation Summit is organized by Cleveland Clinic Innovations, the development and commercialization arm of Cleveland Clinic.
                
                The list of breakthrough technologies was selected by a committee of Cleveland Clinic subject matter experts, led by Will Morris, M.D., executive medical director for Cleveland Clinic Innovations, and Akhil Saklecha, M.D., managing director of Cleveland Clinic Ventures.
                
                Here, in order of anticipated importance, are the Top 3 Medical Innovations for 2021:</h4>
                <h1 class="m-1-h">1. Gene Therapy for Hemoglobinopathies
                </h1>
                <h4 class="m-1-p">Hemoglobinopathies are genetic disorders affecting the structure or production of the hemoglobin molecule – the red protein responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood. The most common hemoglobinopathies include sickle cell disease and thalassemia – which combined affect more than 330,000 children born worldwide every year and more than 100,000 patients with sickle cell disease in the United States alone. The latest research in hemoglobinopathies has brought an experimental gene therapy, giving those who have the condition the potential ability to make functional hemoglobin molecules – reducing the presence of sickled blood cells or ineffective red blood cells in thalassemia to prevent associated complications.</h4>
                <h1 class="m-2-h">2. Novel Drug for Primary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis</h1>
                <h4 class="m-2-p">In individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), the immune system attacks the fatty protective myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibers – causing communication problems between the brain and the rest of the body that can result in permanent damage or deterioration and eventual death. Approximately 15 percent of people with MS experience a disease subset known as primary-progressive, characterized by gradual onset and steady progression of signs and symptoms. A new, FDA-approved therapeutic monoclonal antibody with a novel target is the first and only MS treatment for the primary-progressive population.</h4>
                <h1 class="m-3-h">3. Smartphone-Connected Pacemaker Devices</h1>
                <h4 class="m-3-p">Implantable devices like pacemakers and defibrillators deliver electrical impulses to the heart muscle chambers to contract and pump blood to the body. They are used to prevent or correct arrhythmias – heartbeats that are uneven, too slow or too fast. Remote monitoring of these devices is an essential part of care. Traditionally, remote monitoring of this device takes place through a bed-side console that transmits the pacemaker or defibrillator data to the physician. Though millions of patients have pacemakers and defibrillators, many lack a basic understanding of the device or how it functions and adherence to remote monitoring has been suboptimal. Bluetooth-enabled pacemaker devices can remedy these issues of disconnection between patients and their cardiac treatment. Used in conjunction with a mobile app, these connected devices allow patients greater insight into the health data from the pacemakers and transmit the health information to their physicians.</h4>
                <h1 class="t-3-h">Cars</h1>
                <dl class="cars-dl">
                    <dt>Tata Gravitas</dt>
                    <dd>Tata Gravitas is a car that we have seen at the Auto Expo and we expect Tata to launch it soon. It is a 7 seater version of the Harrier. Tata Harrier is one of the best SUVs in its class in terms of safety and features. There are other cars in this list who we are expecting as a competition for the Tata Harrier.</dd>
                    <dt>Tata HBX</dt>
                    <dd>Tata HBX is a small SUV which will sit below the Tata Nexon in the lineup. The HBX was also shown at the Auto Expo 2020 and has been spotted a number of times while doing test runs. The car will have a competitor from Hyundai which also makes its way in this list further ahead.</dd>
                    <dt>Renault Kiger</dt>
                    <dd>One of the next Confirm launches in 2021 will be the Renault Kiger. Renault has virtually shown the concept of the car. It will be based on the Nissan Magnite which has been recently launched and we expect it to be the last launch of 2020. The Kiger might visually look like Triber from the front with the rear side like the Nissan Magnite.</dd>
